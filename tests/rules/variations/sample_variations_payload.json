  "text": "VARIATIONS. None of the scope, pricing, or time schedule provisions of a Call-Off is to be modified otherwise than in accordance with Clause 14 or Clause 31.6. Contractor shall provide the duly completed Variation Order Request as soon as reasonably practicable and notify if unable to provide all requested information within five (5) business days; pricing shall use the same rates or demonstrably commensurate rates and time impact shall be supported by proper critical path analysis. If Contractor disagrees with a Variation Order, Company may instruct Contractor to proceed immediately; Contractor shall not sign contingent upon changes. Contractor shall issue its request for a Variation Order immediately where the event relates to Work offshore, and in any other case as soon as possible and in any event not later than (3) days; failure to request within that period results in no entitlement. Any Change in Law affecting Taxes or business in general does not entitle a Party to a Variation Order; strict enforcement of previously unenforced law does not constitute a Change in Law. Any Variation Order waives cardinal change and cumulative impact claims."
